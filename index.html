    <h1>Spreading the News</h1>
    <p>
        Before the rise of Internet and technologies like the telephone, information would spread very differently than
        when compared to today. Currently we have almost instantaneous access to information about events going on
        across the world. This information comes in such a large stream as well that people are able to discover
        incredible insights from it, such as the <a
            href="http://news.northeastern.edu/2017/05/05/researchers-use-twitter-to-track-the-flu-in-real-time/">Northeastern
        University researchers</a> using Twitter to predict the spread of flu season.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1835 however, news would spread very differently. Going out across all available travel ways through
        newspapers and couriers. The starkest difference between then and now is the time it would take to receive the
        information. One example of this would be the <a href="https://www.ncpedia.org/shenandoah-css">CSS
        Shenandoah</a> a ship that operated as apart of the Confederate States Navy, during the American Civil War. The
        Shenandoah actually fought until six months after the American Civil War ended, because they were executing on
        news that was outdated. The Shenandoah actually learned of the Confederacy's surrender off of the coast of
        California after which disposed of their cannons and repainted their ship. Sailing to Liverpool, England in hope
        of being treated fairly.

        The map below features two different modes. First is a simulation of how news would spread from one
        location to all others across the quickest routes, select "Spreading news across all travel ways" and then
        click of the cities to watch how news would spread from one place to all its neighboring cities.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second mode is "Travel Time between 2 cities", where you select a mode of transportation and a pair of
        cities. The map will then show you the quickest route you can take and display how long it would take.
